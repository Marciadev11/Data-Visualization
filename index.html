            Due to the advancement of technology and medicine, the global life expectancy has increased by more than 6 years
            between 2000 and 2019 (WHO,2019). However, there are also other factors related to the increase in life expectancy that vary
            between different countries. Many of these factors are related to the economic status of a country and  government funding 
            towards healthcare. The focus of this visualization is the life expectancy of South East Asian countries.

          The map graph above shows the life expectancy around the world in 2015. Most of the countries in the
          continent America, Asia, Europe and Australia have a life expectancy greater than 60 years old. However, some
          countries in the continent of Africa have a lower life expectancy which is below than 60 years old.

                <p>The South East Asian countries are labeled and are in the color blue in the graph and other countries of the 
                    world are in light gray. As can be seen in the graph on the left, there seems to be a positive correlation 
                    between a country's economic status, which is measure by the human development index and GDP, and its average
                    life expectancy. Across the different years, the graph shows that when there is a high HDI there is an increase 
                    in life expectancy in the country because the higher HDI indicates a higher standard of living. Furthermore, the
                    graph also shows that countries with a higher GDP have greater life expectancy compared to countries with a lower
                    GDP. The graph also shows that through the year 2000 until 2015, HDI and Life expectancy have increased. 

                  <br><br>

                  Singapore is the South East Asian country that has the highest life expectancy, HDI and GDP on average and has been 
                  consistently leading throughout the years. This could be due to the fact that Sinagpore is already a developed country while
                  other South East Asian countries are still developing. Timor-Leste, Cambodia and Maynmar had the lowest life expectancy
                  and HDI in the early 2000 but their life expectancy and HDI have significantly improved in later years.

                  Government expenditure on healthcare are some efforts that can help increase life expectancy in the country. 
                  In most Southeast asian countries health expenditures have been slightly increasing over the years. 
                  Cambodia's health expenditure has been the highest over the years compared to other ASEAN countries but faced 
                  a drop in 2007. According to Hughes (2008), In 2007, Cambodia held its communal election and prime minister
                  Hun Sen won which caused political tension as problems with inequality arose. While Timor 
                  Leste has the lowest health expenditure over the years because, According to Evaluation Group (2011),
                  Timor-Leste still faces the challenge of economic instability, limited human capacity and political tensions.

          <p>
            From the graph, it shows that, on average, South East Asian countries have a higher adult mortality rate compared
            to European countries. This may be due to other factors such as diseases, climate, crime rates and quality of health care. 
            Among the South East Asian countries, the Philippines has the highest adult mortality with 219 deaths of people between the 
            age of 15 to 60 years old per 1000 population. Following it is Indonesian with 189 deaths and then Cambodia with 273 deaths. 
            Siangpore has the lowest adult mortality rate with only 73 deaths of people between the age of 15 to 60 years old per 1000 
            population which makes sense as they are the South East Asian country with the highest life expectancy.
